## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6699CC) that evokes trust and reliability, appropriate for a scheduling app.
- Background color: A very light blue (#F0F8FF), nearly white, for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A soft violet (#9370DB) to highlight key actions and important dates without being jarring.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability, paired with 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headings, lending a touch of personality appropriate for an educational context.
- Use a consistent set of simple, line-based icons to represent different task categories and levels of priority. Favor established conventions to maximize clarity.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout for schedule and task overviews, making it easy to scan and interact with the interface on a daily basis. Each card should display the content needed to quickly digest the information, like subject, time, and contact person.
